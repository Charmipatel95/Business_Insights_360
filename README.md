# Business_Insights_360
## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware is growing really fast, and now they're jumping into using PowerBI to look at data for the first time. They want to beat their competitors and make better decisions using data. This project is all about giving clear answers to questions about money, sales, advertising, and how they get their products to customers.
I worked on this project by following the Codebasics PowerBi Course

## :office: Company‚Äôs background

AltiQ Hardware has expanded globally and sells computers and accessories through three main channels: 
- Retailers,
- Direct sales
- Distributors.
Unfortunately, a recent venture into the American market resulted in unexpected losses, based on surveys, intuition, and basic Excel analysis. Unlike their competitors, who have robust analytics teams, AltiQ realizes they need to invest in their own analytics team to make smarter decisions and thrive in the industry.

      - This table is used to forecast the customer‚Äôs need in advance, which can help in
        - Higher customer satisfaction
        - Reduced cost in warehouses for storage purpose
    - The table is denormalized by data engineering team, as it is a data warehouse which is aimed to be used for analytical work.

## :inbox_tray: Importing data into PowerBi

- Since our project uses MySQL as the database, we'll need to import datasets from MySQL into PowerBI. To do this, we'll need to provide the necessary credentials to access the database.

## :card_file_box: Data Model

- Think of data modeling as the blueprint for our reports‚Äîit's the backbone that everything else relies on. If our blueprint isn't strong, our reports won't perform well. So, we'll make sure our data modeling is spot-on.
- We're using the Snowflake method to keep everything neat and tidy.

### :bar_chart: Dashboard designing

Once we've got the mockups as our guide, it's full steam ahead for the team to start crafting visuals and whipping up measures whenever they're needed.

## :house: Home view

On the main Home view, you'll see a menu with various options like Information, Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, Executive, Products, and Support. Just choose the one you're interested in by clicking its button, and you'll be whisked away to that specific view page in no time.
